# Find All Pokemon
 
This silly little program simply searches the *Serebii National Dex* for all Pokémon in order and outputs them to a file when you type "save".
I made this program really quickly to help me create another program, and decided it's easy to read and probably easy to learn from. So here it is.

Simply run the program, watch it list all the Pokémon, and type save when it's done to output the file. 
**OR EVEN BETTER**

Simply read what the program is doing, and make your own. I used the package *Angle Sharp* to scrape the HTML from Serebii.
